# Air-Traffic-Control-System
🚀 Air Traffic Control System (C, POSIX, IPC, Multithreading)

A POSIX-compliant Air Traffic Control System simulating real-world aviation workflows using multi-process and multi-threading. The system manages planes, airports, and an air traffic controller (ATC) using message queues, process synchronization (mutex/semaphores), and inter-process communication (IPC).

Key Features:
✈️ Multi-process Simulation: Passenger & cargo planes, airports, and ATC as independent processes.
📡 Inter-process Communication: Message queues for coordinated takeoff, landing, and runway management.
🔄 Thread Synchronization: Mutex/semaphore-based runway allocation to prevent conflicts.
🛫 Real-time Execution: Simulates boarding, landing, and departure using process scheduling.

🎯 Tech Stack: C, POSIX, IPC (Pipes & Message Queues), Multithreading (Pthreads), Synchronization (Mutex/Semaphores).
